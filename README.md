2d Trees
============
This is a Java implementation of a 2D tree, a data structure used for efficiently storing and querying points in two-dimensional space. A 2D tree is a binary tree in which each node represents a point in the plane and each level of the tree corresponds to a different dimension.

Project Goals
--------------
 - Implement and use Point and Rectangle class
 - Design and implement effiently the 2d-tree
 - Design a menu that lets the user manages the methods of the 2d tree
